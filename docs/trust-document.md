# IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT

THIS IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT is made this {date}, by and between {grantor} (the "Grantor" and "Beneficiary"), and SmartLaw LLC (the "Trustee"). The name of this trust shall be SmartLaw Trust {id}.

**Purpose:** This trust is established for the purpose of holding property, for the benefit of the beneficiary, in accordance with future agreements and assignments made using an Ethereum smart contract. A smart contract is an agreement whose execution is automated by computer code.

The Trustee shall hold the trust property in accordance with the following provisions:

**Assignment of beneficial interest:** The Trustee will assign to the beneficiary a digital token representing the rights to receive by way of conveyance the trust property. A unique identifier for this token is found in Schedule "A". This will be referred to as the Conveyance Token.

*The Grantor may transfer this Conveyance Token through the SmartNote Ethereum contract. Transferring this digital token on the blockchain assigns full beneficial interest in this trust to the recipient of the transfer, and assigns to the holder of the Conveyance Token the exclusive right to request that the Trustee convey the property and dissolve the trust.
The beneficiary may assign all beneficial interest in the trust property by calling the assignBeneficialInterest() function in the smart contract.*

**Verification of beneficiary:** The identity of the beneficiary may be ascertained by performing a lookup on the public Ethereum blockchain using the getBeneficiary() function of the SmartLaw contract.

*The name of the current beneficiary may be determined at any time by calling the getBeneficiary() function of the SmartNote contract.*

**Dissolution of the trust:** The beneficiary may call the DissolveTrust() function on the Ethereum blockchain to dissolve this trust. In this event, the Trustee shall convey, transfer and deed the property of the trust to the beneficiary.

*Requests for the Trustee to convey the property and dissolve the trust may not be made in writing, but must be executed through the SmartNote Ethereum contract by calling the RequestConveyance() function. Only the holder of the conveyance token is able to call this function.*

**Reliance on Blockchain:** The Trustee may rely fully on the public records of the Ethereum blockchain to ascertain all records of assignment of beneficial interest.

**Loans secured by property of trust:** The SmartNote Ethereum contract allows for the holder of the Conveyance Token to use the Conveyance Token as collateral in loans managed by the Ethereum blockchain. The possessor of the Conveyance Token may digitally sign to transfer the conveyance token into escrow using smart contracts.

**Private trust:** The trust herein created is a private trust, and the Trustee shall not be required to obtain the order of approval of any Court for the exercise of any powers or discretion herein given.  The Trustee shall not be required to enter into any bond as Trustee nor shall it be required to return to any Court any periodic formal accounting of its administration of the said trust, but said Trustee shall render annual accounts to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such trust.

**Irrevocability** This trust is and shall be irrevocable and after the execution of this Trust Agreement the Grantor shall have no right, title, or interest in or power, privilege or incident of ownership in regard to any of said property and/or money and shall have no right to alter, amend, revoke or terminate this trust or any provision hereof.

*The Grantor may not request reconveyance of the trust property, and may not revoke any portion of this trust agreement, without access to and control of this digital token.

The Grantor expressly waives all rights and powers, whether alone or in conjunction with others, and regardless of when or from what source he may have acquired such rights or powers, to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the trusts, or any of the terms of this Agreement, in whole or in part. By this instrument the Grantor relinquishes absolutely and forever all his possession or enjoyment of, or right to the income from, the trust property, and all his right and power, whether alone or in conjunction with others, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the trust property, or the income.*

**Trustee compensation** The Trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for its services hereunder. Such compensation may be collected annually by the Trustee and shall be shown in its annual accounting. *Allow for trustee fees to be handled through smart-contract*

**Trustee not liable:** The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss to the trust estate occasioned by its acts in good faith, and in any event shall be liable only for its own willful negligence or default, and not for honest errors of judgment or for interest on uninvested funds.

**Jurisdiction:** This trust has been executed and delivered in the State of _________________ and shall be construed and administered according to the laws of that state.

This Irrevocable Trust Agreement may be executed in any number of copies, each of which shall be an original and no other copy need to be produced.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Trust Agreement has been executed by the parties listed above.
