# IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT

THIS IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT is made this {date}, by and between {grantor} (the "Grantor" and "Beneficiary"), and SmartLaw LLC (the "Trustee"). The name of this trust shall be 'SmartLaw Trust {id}''.

**Purpose of trust:** This trust is established for the purpose of holding property, for the benefit of the beneficiary, in accordance with future agreements and assignments made using the Ethereum blockchain.

**Trust property:** The trust property is listed in Schedule A. The Grantor hereby grants, deeds, and conveys said property to this trust.

The Trustee shall hold the trust property in accordance with the following provisions:

**Trust recorded on blockchain:** A record of this trust has been registered on the Ethereum public blockchain with a unique identifier (referenced in Schedule A.) The public Ethereum blockchain will serve as an official record-keeping and record-updating mechanism for this trust. The Trustee may rely fully on these records in good faith.

**Use of smart contract:** The ability to update records related to this trust on the blockchain is regulated by a smart contract. Smart contracts are deterministic immutable computer code systems designed to facilitate, verify, record, and enforce certain protocols, using distributed public records stored in a blockchain.

**Digital signatures:** The security of updates to records through the smart contract is regulated through cryptographic digital signatures. All parties agree that their cryptographic signatures will have the full legal weight and significance of a physical signature. Public keys for each party are recorded in Schedule A.

**Assignment of beneficial interest:** The beneficiary may use the Smart Contract to assign and transfer all rights, title, and beneficial interest under the trust, including the powers of direction and revocation, and the right to dissolve the trust and receive the trust property in conveyance. This assignment may not be done offline, but must be performed by calling the assignBeneficialInterest() function on the smart contract.

**Verification of beneficiary:** The identity of the current beneficiary may be ascertained by performing a lookup on the public Ethereum blockchain using the getBeneficiary() function of the SmartLaw contract.

**Dissolution of the trust:** The beneficiary may call the dissolveTrust() function on the smart contract to dissolve this trust. In this event, the Trustee shall convey, transfer and deed the property of the trust to the beneficiary.

**Loans secured by property of trust:** The smart contract allows for the beneficiary to grant secured interests in the trust, for purposes of securing a loan. During such a loan, certain functions of the smart contract may not be available to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary defaults under these loan arrangements their beneficial interest in the trust may be permanently lost, or transferred to the secured party. The actual terms and process for default will be executed by the smart contract, and may include a public auction on the blockchain where their beneficial interest is sold to the highest bidder.

**Private trust:** The trust herein created is a private trust, and the Trustee shall not be required to obtain the order of approval of any Court for the exercise of any powers or discretion herein given.  The Trustee shall not be required to enter into any bond as Trustee nor shall it be required to return to any Court any periodic formal accounting of its administration of the said trust.

**Irrevocability** This trust is and shall be irrevocable and after the execution of this Trust Agreement the Grantor shall have no right, title, or interest in or power, privilege or incident of ownership in regard to any of said property and/or money and shall have no right to alter, amend, revoke or terminate this trust or any provision hereof.

**Trustee compensation** The Trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for its services. A standard fee schedule is included in Schedule B.

**Trustee not liable:** The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss to the trust estate occasioned by its acts in good faith, and in any event shall be liable only for its own willful negligence or default, and not for honest errors of judgment or for interest on uninvested funds.

**Jurisdiction:** This trust has been executed and delivered in the State of _________________ and shall be construed and administered according to the laws of that state.

This Irrevocable Trust Agreement may be executed in any number of copies, each of which shall be an original and no other copy need to be produced.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Trust Agreement has been executed by the parties listed above.
